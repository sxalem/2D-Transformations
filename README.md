# 2D-Transformations

This project demonstrates basic 2D transformations using Python. It includes classes for translating, rotating, and transforming 2D points.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `runner.py` to see the transformations applied to a set of sample points.

## Files

- `point2d.py`: Defines the Point2D class representing 2D points.
- `translate.py`: Defines the Translate class for translating points.
- `rotate.py`: Defines the Rotate class for rotating points.
- `transformation.py`: Defines the Transformation class for combining translation and rotation.
- `runner.py`: Script to run and visualize the transformations on sample points.
